--How to run the Weather API powered by AWS Serverless--

NOTE: THIS IS A LARAVEL PHP CODEBASE AND PLEASE DO MAKE SURE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE INSTALLED IN ORDER FOR THE APPLICATION TO WORK. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS WILL MAKE THE PROJECT UNUSABLE

Requirements:
1. Download and install PHP 8.2.0 in your environment. Please see the below output of the PHP version in the command line/terminal.

    PHP 8.2.0 (cli) (built: Dec  6 2022 15:31:23) (ZTS Visual C++ 2019 x64)
    Copyright (c) The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v4.2.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies 

2. Download and install Node.js v18.15.0 in your environment. Please see the below output of the Node.js version in the command line/terminal.

    v18.15.0

Below are the different methods to run the API:

A. Steps to run the API using POSTMAN:
1. Copy the submitted files from the Codility platform or you can clone the repo from my github, https://github.com/drewubaldeayson/aws-serverless-test-laravel. 
2. Install the serverless command 'npm install -g serverless' without quotes.
2. Change directory to aws-serverless-test-laravel-api root directory
3. Run composer install. 
4. Create AWS access keys. Please refer to this link, https://bref.sh/docs/installation/aws-keys.html, for the better guide.
5. Setup those keys by running:
    serverless config credentials --provider aws --key <key> --secret <secret>
6. Run 'serverless deploy' command without quotes
7. Once the command finishes, it should print a URL like this one (sample only): 
https://3pjp2yiw97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
8. Use the URL that is generated by the serverless deploy command as the main API source link. Make sure to copy it.
9. Open the Postman application, so we can test the API with an API key. Make sure to create a collection for this sample test and create a GET Request.
10. You will need to run the first GET API which is the GET Weather api. Extend this GET Weather API '/api/v1/weather' to the AWS link. For example, https://3pjp2yiw97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/v1/weather
11. Now, we need a parameter. Please make sure to add 'postCode=' and '&country=' in the url beside the 'weather' word. For example: https://3pjp2yiw97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/v1/weather?postCode=1212&country=PH
12. Lastly, append this API key, "f3969c45-f33d-48f0-9ab7-f4f047725a56" in the parameter for example: "&apiKey=f3969c45-f33d-48f0-9ab7-f4f047725a56"
13. Hit the 'Send' button
This will display the data in the below format as based in the requirement of the test:
    {
        "lon": 150.8667,
        "lat": -33.7167,
        "main": "Clouds",
        "description": "overcast clouds",
        "temp": 290.27,
        "feels_like": 290.23,
        "temp_min": 288.57,
        "temp_max": 291.11,
        "pressure": 1028,
        "humidity": 84
    }




B. Steps to run the API in any BROWSER:
1. Copy the submitted files from the Codility platform or you can clone the repo from my github, https://github.com/drewubaldeayson/aws-serverless-test-laravel. 
2. Install the serverless command 'npm install -g serverless' without quotes.
2. Change directory to aws-serverless-test-laravel-api root directory
3. Run composer install. 
4. Create AWS access keys. Please refer to this link, https://bref.sh/docs/installation/aws-keys.html, for the better guide.
5. Setup those keys by running:
    serverless config credentials --provider aws --key <key> --secret <secret>
6. Run 'serverless deploy' command without quotes
7. Once the command finishes, it should print a URL like this one (sample only): 
https://3pjp2yiw97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
8. Use the URL that is generated by the serverless deploy command as the main API source link. Make sure to copy it.
9. Open a web browser, so we can test the API with an API key.
10. You will need to test the first GET API which is the GET Weather api. Extend this GET Weather API '/api/v1/weather' to the copied link. For example, https://3pjp2yiw97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/v1/weather
11. Now, we need a parameter. Please make sure to add 'postCode=' and '&country=' in the url beside the 'weather' word. For example: https://3pjp2yiw97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/v1/weather?postCode=1212&country=PH
12. Lastly, append this API key, "f3969c45-f33d-48f0-9ab7-f4f047725a56" in the parameter for example: "&apiKey=f3969c45-f33d-48f0-9ab7-f4f047725a56"
13. Hit the 'Enter' key in the keyboard or press the 'Go' icon in the URL of the browser.
This will display the data in the below format as based in the requirement of the test:
    {
        "lon": 150.8667,
        "lat": -33.7167,
        "main": "Clouds",
        "description": "overcast clouds",
        "temp": 290.27,
        "feels_like": 290.23,
        "temp_min": 288.57,
        "temp_max": 291.11,
        "pressure": 1028,
        "humidity": 84
    }


Last guide if all else fails to run:

1. Copy the submitted files from the Codility platform or you can clone the repo from my github, https://github.com/drewubaldeayson/aws-serverless-test-laravel. 
2. Open a terminal/command line and go to the aws-serverless-test-laravel-api root directory
3. Enter composer install
4. Enter php artisan serve. This will generate a link in the command prompt/terminal in which you need to copy to the browser or the postman to test the API.
5. Create this URL with the parameters given in the above steps. 
For example: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/weather?postalCode=1101&countryCode=PH&apiKey=f3969c45-f33d-48f0-9ab7-f4f047725a56


You're good to go!
